# React Team Builder
**This project is a website built with React for creating and managing programming teams and their members. You can access the site [here](https://arthurbenczdecamargo.github.io/react-team-builder/).**

## Overview
React Team Builder is a dynamic web application that allows users to create and manage programming teams, and organize team members. Users can easily register new members and teams, and make changes to the existing ones. The application manages teams and members using **React's `useState` hook**, which allows the app to update the displayed data dynamically in response to user interactions. For easy identification and modification, each team and member has a unique ID.

Users can also view the created teams and their members, and perform actions such as favoriting members, deleting members, and changing the color of each team.
